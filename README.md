### Description

[Update: (03-30-08)Scanning support added using ezTwain {http://www.geocities.com/smigman.geo/mci/download.html} You may scan into a transparent layer. Some bugs removed and menus improved.]...This is modification of vbPaint by Theo Zacharias (theo_yz@yahoo.com). I've added transparent layers and the abilty to create panoramas. It has filters, the ability to edit the layers individually and to flatten or merge down. It's therefore a little like Photshop. The picture tells the story. Update(7-16-07): Bugs fixed. Update(07-10-07): I removed the un-needed references and components. I've also added the ability to cut &amp; paste from the Desktop with transparency. Update (07-19-07): I've added a help file (online as to not increase the file size) [http://www.moosenose.com/vbPainter/vbPainter.htm]. It can also be accessed through the help menu.
